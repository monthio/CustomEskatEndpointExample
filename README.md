# Monthio Custom Eskat Endpoint -- Example Server

This repo provides code as reference for the Custom eskat endpoint feature of
the Monthio Credit flow.

To read more about the specification of endpoints see our [documentation](https://monthio.readme.io/docs/ingesting-existing-eskat-data-1).


To use this implementation change the values in `appsettings.json` to match
your configured endpoint and update the code in `EskatDataProvider` to access
your source of eskat data.
